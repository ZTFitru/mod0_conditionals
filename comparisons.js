// In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated to achieve the desired result.
// One example is already completed. Your task is to complete any remaining prompt.
// Make sure to run the file in your command line using `node <filename>.js`


// -------------------
// PART 1: Comparing variables
// -------------------

var numberTeachers = 4
var numberStudents = 20
var stringTeachers = "4"
var numberDogs = 0

// EXAMPLE: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?", numberTeachers > numberStudents);
// this should log: "Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?" false

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers?
// this should log: false
console.log(numberTeachers === stringTeachers);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?
// this should log: true
console.log(numberTeachers !== numberStudents);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?
// this should log: false
console.log(numberStudents >= 21);


// #-------------------
// PART 2: Articulating what you are doing
// #-------------------

// For the following prompts, you will be given a line of code and your task is to type out a comment,in English, explaining what that line of code is doing, including what the comparison will evaluate to.

var friends = 6;
var siblings = 2;
console.log(friends > siblings);
// YOU DO: Explain.
// the number 6 is stored in a variable called friends and the number 2 is stored in a variable called siblings. 
// the console.log has friends being greater than siblings.
// since 6 is stored in friends and 2 stored in siblings, we can evaluate the outcome being true since 6 is greater than 2.


var attendees = 9;
var meals = 8;
console.log(attendees !== meals);
// YOU DO: Explain.
// just like before number 9 is stored in the variable attendees and number 8 is stored in the variable meals.
// the console.log will output the result.
// in this case "!==" is asking if the two variables are not strictly equal, in this case since they are different the output is true.

// #-------------------
// PART 3: Logical Operators
// #-------------------

var isHungry = true;
var finishedHomework = false;

// EXAMPLE:
// Determine if the user is hungry and has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry && finishedHomework);
// Determine if the user is hungry or has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry || finishedHomework);

var lovesToPlay = true;
var lovesDogPark = false;
var lovesTreats = true;
var age = 1;

// YOU DO:
// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves treats
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesTreats);

// YOU DO:
// Determine if the dog loves to play or loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay || lovesDogPark);

// YOU DO:
// Determine if the dog loves to play and is a puppy
// HINT: Use the age variable and assume that a puppy is less than 2 years old
console.log(lovesToPlay && age < 2);
