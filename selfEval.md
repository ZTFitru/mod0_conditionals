# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
- I feel good in my understanding and fluency with the comparison operators, the lesson plan that was provided to me and the zoom classes
I attended were helpful.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
- I feel confident in my understanding with the logical operators, it helped watching the operators compare two values and outputting an answer 
based on which one you include.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
- Watching the instructors and doing the practice exercises have helped me better understand how the `if else` statements operate. 

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
- I spent about an hour after we finished the zoom class, focusing on doing the practices over and over again. Then I spent an hour before 
I went to the gym the next day and completed what was needed after I came back. It lined up almost perfect with the time estimate. 

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- After I finish the assignments I am assigned to complete, I will go back and do the practice challenges to feel more confident.
At the moment I don't need to adjust my calendar, but if I am feeling like I am not understanding the topic, I will adjust. 

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- Everyone has been very helpful on `Slack` when questions are brought up. If I need help or have a question, that will be the place
I would ask after I do some `Google` search.
